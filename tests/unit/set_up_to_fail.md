**In the example scenarios posited by the researchers, do you feel that either the bosses or subordinates acted out of ill-will? Who do you feel was most at fault? If it's difficult for you to choose, why?**

In the example given by the researchers, I felt that the boss and subordinate could have easily avoided the whole situation. The boss could have been more explicit in his request and/or asked the subordinate if he understood the request either at the time of assignment or after the first report was turned in.

The subordinate could have asked for clairification about the task he was given at any point instead of personalizing the task right after it's assignment. Either way I thnk that good communication from the start would have strengthened their relationship. It's hard to say who was more at fault in this situation.

**In the section "Getting it Right" the authors outline communication steps to break through the Set-Up-To-Fail cycle. What do you think of division of responsibility in these steps between the boss and subordinate?**

The steps for breaking from the set-up-to-fail cycle described in the article seem like they rely heavily on the boss to want to take the first step to break out of the cycle. I think that a subordinate should be able to approach their boss in a similar way but I can also see that it might take a decent amount of courage to take that step towards voicing their opinions directly.

Each step in the process requires both sides to be open to what the other has to say. It's also their responsibility to keep things professional and less personal. Communication is essential to every type of relationship. These are good steps towards encouraging and maintaining a productive relationship between the boss and subordinate.
